### DONE

- displaying mortgage products
- use zod to validate which mortgage products are valid
- able to create an application
- able to view list of applications
- able to edit application
- prettier/linting/tidied CreateReactApp files
- localized
- deployed

### QUESTIONS

- how does `x-nesto-candidat` work?

### NOTES

- french translations are just whatever Google suggested
- would spend more time structuring CSS (either modules, tailwind, styled components, etc)
- I had come up with a decent sorting function for the mortgage products before I implemented zod and realized that there was only one valid product for each, and so sorting isn't really necessary :/
- I randomly picked what "tags" to feature on a mortgage product card, as well as the sorting options ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
